# RequestAuthentication provides a way of setting up JWT providers that we can use for authentication
# this will allow us to specify what are the 3rd party libraries we want to use to handle the auth
# this example will use firebase as an issuer so "istio" can use it to validate the authentication
# ---
# Because the "RequestAuthentication" is defined in the namespace "retail-store" it will only apply those providers to this namespace only
# if we want to make this a global option among all the other namespaces we would use the namespace "istio-system"
